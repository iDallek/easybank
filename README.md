## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Vitest](https://nextjs.org/) - Testing framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Typed JavaScript


### What I learned

##### Implementation of Mobile-First Workflow

I embraced the "mobile-first" paradigm for responsive design, allowing me to create a more user-friendly experience for mobile devices while simultaneously establishing a solid foundation for expansion to larger screens.

##### Mastery of Vue.js as the Primary Framework

Exploring and utilizing Vue.js as the primary JavaScript framework has provided me with a deeper understanding of how to efficiently build dynamic and scalable interfaces.

##### Integration of Typescript for Typing

Incorporating Typescript into the project strengthened code maintenance, providing early error detection and enhancing the application's scalability.

##### Utilization of Vitest for Testing

I learned to use Vitest for writing automated tests, ensuring not only code quality but also allowing me to explore and understand the fundamental principles of unit and integration testing.

### Continued development

Upon completing this project, I identified areas for future developments:

- **Deepening Testing Knowledge:** Exploring advanced testing techniques for broader coverage.

- **Exploring Advances in the Vue.js Ecosystem:** Keeping up-to-date with Vue.js updates and exploring more advanced features.

- **Incorporating Accessibility Practices:** Ensuring the project is accessible for all users.

### Useful resources

- [Vue folder structure](https://gist.github.com/plinionaves/1e619a414602cd535c6b73a035ae2f75) - A style guide, emphasizing folder structure, naming conventions, and best practices for developing and organizing Vue.js components within the project.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) - Define a standard for commit messages used in version control, enforcing a structured format for clear and automated semantic versioning, making it easier to understand changes and automate release processes.
